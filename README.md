# ioBroker.nuki
=================

This ioBroker adapter allows to control and monitor the [Nuki Smart Lock](https://nuki.io/de/) by using the API of the Nuki Bridge.

Since this is my very first attempt of creating my own ioBroker adapter and also my premiere for using GitHub I will move slowly in order to learn how to do this. So please don't be impatient.

## Requirements
* A Nuki Smart Lock (obviously) and a Nuki (hardware or software) Bridge.
* A running instance of ioBroker.  

## Changelog

### 0.0.1
* (smaragdschlange) initial release
